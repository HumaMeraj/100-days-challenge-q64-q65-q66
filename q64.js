//Combine Strings and Numbers: Write a function that merges a piece of text with a number. For example, if provided with "Age: " and 30, it should give back "Age: 30".
// This function mixes a text and a number into one text
// Joins the text and number into a single text
function combineStringAndNumber(text, number) {
    return text + number;
}
// Trying it out with "Age: " and 30
console.log(combineStringAndNumber("age:", 30)); // Shows "Age: 30"
