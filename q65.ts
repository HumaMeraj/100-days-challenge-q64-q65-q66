//Determine the Remainder: Make a function that gets two numbers and shows the leftover from dividing them using the % sign. For example, remainder(5, 2) should give 1.


// This function finds the leftover of dividing two numbers
function remainder(num1: number, num2: number):number{
    return num1 % num2
}

// Trying it with 9 divided by 2

console.log(remainder (9, 2));         //  shows result 1
